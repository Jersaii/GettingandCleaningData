# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
In this repo, there are three key elements that should be considered while navigating through this repo:

`CodeBook.md` a code book describing the variables included in the final data set and the process of tidying up the data

`run_analysis.R` an R script responsible of achieving the following points:

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   
`FinalData.txt` the exported final data set as a .txt file  

Finally, here's the source were the data set was retrieved from: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>
